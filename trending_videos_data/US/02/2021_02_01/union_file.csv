WHY DO I CALL MY FANS GREG?
Greg is the strongest family on the internet, we're the fastest growing channel on Youtube, and we make fire content. So, instead of making up some pun using my name and calling my fans that, I decided to use a different name entirely. A name so strong, haters tremble when it is spoken. WE ARE GREG. AND WE ARE TAKING OVER THE INTERNET. And all you have to do to join is hit subscribe and turn on notifications.

WandaVision’s fourth episode, ""We Interrupt This Program,"" reveals the story of Monica Rambeau in a dramatic hospital scene set concurrently with Avengers Endgame. What is SWORD's history and mission, and what dark agenda could Acting Director Tyler Hayward be working towards with Monica and Westview? Erik Voss breaks down all the hidden Easter Eggs and SWORD clues, including the confirmed importance of hexagons, why locals have amnesia about Westview, and the deeper meaning of the episode's most terrifying jump-scare, Vision appearing as a corpse.

First, trading of meme stocks have been HALTED MULTIPLES TIMES due to EXTREME volatility:

This happens when a stock increases in value SO MUCH that it completely detaches from its fundamentals…so, the New York Stock Exchange reserves the right to TEMPORARILY suspend trading to give its investors a time to “cool off.” 

Now, I’ve been saying this for quite some time - but, this is going to be EXTREMELY difficult to regulate, because it becomes IMPOSSIBLE to figure out where to draw the line, and at which point someone becomes liable for what they say online.

Second, I realize THIS is what everyone wants me to talk about: Robinhood, and the ALLEGED wrongdoings of GameStop.

On the morning of Thursday, January 28th - Robinhood, along with several other brokerages, disabled their users from being able to BUY certain stocks, like AMC, GameStop, BlackBerry, Nokia, and a few others - ONLY allowing them to SELL their positions, thereby inadvertently causing the price of those stocks to drop SUBSTANTIALLY. 

That completely ELIMINATES the “natural price discovery” of the stock market, where people can FREELY BUY AND SELL a stock for whatever they think it’s worth. 

That’s why, NOW, there’s a push for a class action lawsuit AGAINST Robinhood, claiming that Robinhood has been pulling stocks from its platform in order to slow growth, and help benefit Robinhood’s large institutional investors and partners…not its customers, to who it should owe a fiduciary duty to.
https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.553175/gov.uscourts.nysd.553175.1.0.pdf

Robinhood DID respond to this after the market closed,  saying that this was done as a financial requirement to meet SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. AND…they ended it by saying “To be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.”

Now, to be fair to Robinhood - this DID happen to other platforms, as well, who happen to use APEX Clearing to process their trades, and several brokerages, including TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab, placed heavy restrictions on the stock by increasing their margin requirements “until further notice.” 

I’m trying to be as neutral as possible when it comes to this, because I don’t think it’s fair to just point your finger at Robinhood, when there’s a LOT more to the situation than most of us realize…but, it’s certainly going to require more research to get to the bottom of exactly what’s going on. 

But…the way I see it, this event will ALMOST CERTAINLY cause there to be further regulation to prevent something like this from happening again.

They took the '94 title and everyone was like ""that's just cuz Jordan switched sports!"" So, they clawed their way up from the 6th seed to win it all again in 1995.

The only trouble? When you rise so high, you have farther to fall.

A short-sighted desire to capitalize on aging stars quickly (that'd be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler), and worry about the future later, led to injuries decimating seasons (poor Charles Barkley), backcourt weakness (prob shouldn't have traded away Sam Cassell), bruised egos (looking at you Scottie Pippen) and the end of an era. The Clutch City Rockets couldn't last forever.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,0,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august). Prints and stickers for this animatic will be up soon.",UCYNdP0iy6rP6CTJ-4BG05Kg,https://youtu.be/Xi-cmbVzRDE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xi-cmbVzRDE/mqdefault.jpg,0,,1,US,People & Blogs

WHY DO I CALL MY FANS GREG?
Greg is the strongest family on the internet, we're the fastest growing channel on Youtube, and we make fire content. So, instead of making up some pun using my name and calling my fans that, I decided to use a different name entirely. A name so strong, haters tremble when it is spoken. WE ARE GREG. AND WE ARE TAKING OVER THE INTERNET. And all you have to do to join is hit subscribe and turn on notifications.

They took the '94 title and everyone was like ""that's just cuz Jordan switched sports!"" So, they clawed their way up from the 6th seed to win it all again in 1995.

The only trouble? When you rise so high, you have farther to fall.

A short-sighted desire to capitalize on aging stars quickly (that'd be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler), and worry about the future later, led to injuries decimating seasons (poor Charles Barkley), backcourt weakness (prob shouldn't have traded away Sam Cassell), bruised egos (looking at you Scottie Pippen) and the end of an era. The Clutch City Rockets couldn't last forever.

WandaVision’s fourth episode, ""We Interrupt This Program,"" reveals the story of Monica Rambeau in a dramatic hospital scene set concurrently with Avengers Endgame. What is SWORD's history and mission, and what dark agenda could Acting Director Tyler Hayward be working towards with Monica and Westview? Erik Voss breaks down all the hidden Easter Eggs and SWORD clues, including the confirmed importance of hexagons, why locals have amnesia about Westview, and the deeper meaning of the episode's most terrifying jump-scare, Vision appearing as a corpse.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,9,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august). Prints and stickers for this animatic will be up soon.",UCYNdP0iy6rP6CTJ-4BG05Kg,https://youtu.be/Xi-cmbVzRDE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xi-cmbVzRDE/mqdefault.jpg,9,,1,US,People & Blogs

WHY DO I CALL MY FANS GREG?
Greg is the strongest family on the internet, we're the fastest growing channel on Youtube, and we make fire content. So, instead of making up some pun using my name and calling my fans that, I decided to use a different name entirely. A name so strong, haters tremble when it is spoken. WE ARE GREG.

WandaVision’s fourth episode, ""We Interrupt This Program,"" reveals the story of Monica Rambeau in a dramatic hospital scene set concurrently with Avengers Endgame. What is SWORD's history and mission, and what dark agenda could Acting Director Tyler Hayward be working towards with Monica and Westview? Erik Voss breaks down all the hidden Easter Eggs and SWORD clues, including the confirmed importance of hexagons, why locals have amnesia about Westview, and the deeper meaning of the episode's most terrifying jump-scare, Vision appearing as a corpse.

They took the '94 title and everyone was like ""that's just cuz Jordan switched sports!"" So, they clawed their way up from the 6th seed to win it all again in 1995.

The only trouble? When you rise so high, you have farther to fall.

A short-sighted desire to capitalize on aging stars quickly (that'd be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler), and worry about the future later, led to injuries decimating seasons (poor Charles Barkley), backcourt weakness (prob shouldn't have traded away Sam Cassell), bruised egos (looking at you Scottie Pippen) and the end of an era. The Clutch City Rockets couldn't last forever.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,10,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august). Prints and stickers for this animatic will be up soon.",UCYNdP0iy6rP6CTJ-4BG05Kg,https://youtu.be/Xi-cmbVzRDE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xi-cmbVzRDE/mqdefault.jpg,10,,1,US,People & Blogs

WHY DO I CALL MY FANS GREG?
Greg is the strongest family on the internet, we're the fastest growing channel on Youtube, and we make fire content. So, instead of making up some pun using my name and calling my fans that, I decided to use a different name entirely. A name so strong, haters tremble when it is spoken. WE ARE GREG. AND WE ARE TAKING OVER THE INTERNET. And all you have to do to join is hit subscribe and turn on notifications.

WandaVision’s fourth episode, ""We Interrupt This Program,"" reveals the story of Monica Rambeau in a dramatic hospital scene set concurrently with Avengers Endgame. What is SWORD's history and mission, and what dark agenda could Acting Director Tyler Hayward be working towards with Monica and Westview? Erik Voss breaks down all the hidden Easter Eggs and SWORD clues, including the confirmed importance of hexagons, why locals have amnesia about Westview, and the deeper meaning of the episode's most terrifying jump-scare, Vision appearing as a corpse.

They took the '94 title and everyone was like ""that's just cuz Jordan switched sports!"" So, they clawed their way up from the 6th seed to win it all again in 1995.

The only trouble? When you rise so high, you have farther to fall.

A short-sighted desire to capitalize on aging stars quickly (that'd be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler), and worry about the future later, led to injuries decimating seasons (poor Charles Barkley), backcourt weakness (prob shouldn't have traded away Sam Cassell), bruised egos (looking at you Scottie Pippen) and the end of an era. The Clutch City Rockets couldn't last forever.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,11,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august).

Please don't hate Your Boy for giving you all a bit of tough love...

So many of you Dead Beats are already on your way to Greatness, and Doing the Dang Thing You Wanna Do. Maybe some things are out of your control...In that case, perhaps this song's message isn't aimed at you. But, for those that need a little more motivation, I've GOT YOU COVERED.

Hi I’m Rick Shiels, welcome to my channel RickShielsPGAGolf. This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! 

I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. 

I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. 
I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! 

On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. 

If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.",UCFHZHhZaH7Rc_FOMIzUziJA,https://youtu.be/mzDMC-5UVS4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzDMC-5UVS4/mqdefault.jpg,12,en-GB,1,US,Sports

They took the '94 title and everyone was like ""that's just cuz Jordan switched sports!"" So, they clawed their way up from the 6th seed to win it all again in 1995.

The only trouble? When you rise so high, you have farther to fall.

A short-sighted desire to capitalize on aging stars quickly (that'd be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler), and worry about the future later, led to injuries decimating seasons (poor Charles Barkley), backcourt weakness (prob shouldn't have traded away Sam Cassell), bruised egos (looking at you Scottie Pippen) and the end of an era. The Clutch City Rockets couldn't last forever.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,12,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august).

Hi I’m Rick Shiels, welcome to my channel RickShielsPGAGolf. This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! 

I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. 

I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. 
I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! 

On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. 

If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.",UCFHZHhZaH7Rc_FOMIzUziJA,https://youtu.be/mzDMC-5UVS4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzDMC-5UVS4/mqdefault.jpg,18,en-GB,1,US,Sports

They took the '94 title and everyone was like ""that's just cuz Jordan switched sports!"" So, they clawed their way up from the 6th seed to win it all again in 1995.

The only trouble? When you rise so high, you have farther to fall.

A short-sighted desire to capitalize on aging stars quickly (that'd be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler), and worry about the future later, led to injuries decimating seasons (poor Charles Barkley), backcourt weakness (prob shouldn't have traded away Sam Cassell), bruised egos (looking at you Scottie Pippen) and the end of an era. The Clutch City Rockets couldn't last forever.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,18,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august). Prints and stickers for this animatic will be up soon.",UCYNdP0iy6rP6CTJ-4BG05Kg,https://youtu.be/Xi-cmbVzRDE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xi-cmbVzRDE/mqdefault.jpg,18,,1,US,People & Blogs

It finds and picks up objects (trash), tidies up the living room, opens doors, operates switches and valves, tends the garden, and generally has fun.  Motion of the hand, arm and body are automatically coordinated to simplify manipulation tasks and expand the arm's workspace, making its reach essentially unbounded.

Hi I’m Rick Shiels, welcome to my channel RickShielsPGAGolf. This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! 

I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. 

I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. 
I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! 

On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. 

If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.",UCFHZHhZaH7Rc_FOMIzUziJA,https://youtu.be/mzDMC-5UVS4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzDMC-5UVS4/mqdefault.jpg,20,en-GB,1,US,Sports

——————————————————

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,20,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august). Prints and stickers for this animatic will be up soon.",UCYNdP0iy6rP6CTJ-4BG05Kg,https://youtu.be/Xi-cmbVzRDE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xi-cmbVzRDE/mqdefault.jpg,20,,1,US,People & Blogs

Motion of the hand, arm and body are automatically coordinated to simplify manipulation tasks and expand the arm's workspace, making its reach essentially unbounded.  The behavior shown here was programmed using a new API for mobile manipulation that supports autonomy and user applications, as well as a tablet that lets users do remote operations.

Hi I’m Rick Shiels, welcome to my channel RickShielsPGAGolf. This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! 

I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. 

I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. 
I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! 

On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. 

If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.",UCFHZHhZaH7Rc_FOMIzUziJA,https://youtu.be/mzDMC-5UVS4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzDMC-5UVS4/mqdefault.jpg,21,en-GB,1,US,Sports

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,21,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch.

It finds and picks up objects (trash), tidies up the living room, opens doors, operates switches and valves, tends the garden, and generally has fun.  Motion of the hand, arm and body are automatically coordinated to simplify manipulation tasks and expand the arm's workspace, making its reach essentially unbounded.  The behavior shown here was programmed using a new API for mobile manipulation that supports autonomy and user applications, as well as a tablet that lets users do remote operations.

Hi I’m Rick Shiels, welcome to my channel RickShielsPGAGolf. This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! 

I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. 

I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. 
I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! 

On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. 

If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.",UCFHZHhZaH7Rc_FOMIzUziJA,https://youtu.be/mzDMC-5UVS4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzDMC-5UVS4/mqdefault.jpg,22,en-GB,1,US,Sports

They took the '94 title and everyone was like ""that's just cuz Jordan switched sports!"" So, they clawed their way up from the 6th seed to win it all again in 1995.

The only trouble? When you rise so high, you have farther to fall.

A short-sighted desire to capitalize on aging stars quickly (that'd be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler), and worry about the future later, led to injuries decimating seasons (poor Charles Barkley), backcourt weakness (prob shouldn't have traded away Sam Cassell), bruised egos (looking at you Scottie Pippen) and the end of an era. The Clutch City Rockets couldn't last forever.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the #travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎",UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw,https://youtu.be/UEf-QKVttoU,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UEf-QKVttoU/mqdefault.jpg,22,en,1,US,Travel & Events

I recommend watching ""Desolate"" again before you see this one so you have an idea of where I left off. I wanted someone to be able to watch all three in a row and have them link up timeline-wise.

Song this time around is ""Line of Sight"" by ODESZA. I had a few others I was tossing around but this is the one that stuck. I really hope you enjoy this one, these big projects are very draining. On that note, I think I'm gonna take a break from making these huge animatics...

My plan moving forward is this:

Livestreaming - In a day or so I'd like to do a livestream (at twitch.tv/late_august_) where I go over this animatic panel by panel. I think it will help me arrange my thoughts so that I can make a better process video. Coincidentally, my second item on the list is:

Process video - I said I wanted to do it and I still do, problem is that I'm not a great explainer when it comes to the creative process. I will try my best though.

Smaller projects - I have some ideas for a few DreamSMP projects that will (hopefully) take less time and will allow me to try out new styles and editing techniques

Personal projects - I know it's not what you're here for, but I've got some original ideas that I'm excited about. Hope that's not too heartbreaking.

Here's some links to socials. I'm @late_august_ on almost everything. Follow me:
Instagram - https://instagram.com/late_august_
Twitter - https://twitter.com/late_august_
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/late_august_

Share the video around if you like it, it helps me a bunch. I don't make any money from these videos (any ads you see are put there by the record label that copyright claimed the video) so if you want to support me I have a venmo @late_august_ and a redbubble shop (redbubble.com/people/in-late-august). Prints and stickers for this animatic will be up soon.",UCYNdP0iy6rP6CTJ-4BG05Kg,https://youtu.be/Xi-cmbVzRDE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xi-cmbVzRDE/mqdefault.jpg,22,,1,US,People & Blogs
